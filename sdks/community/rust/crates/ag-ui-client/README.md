# AG-UI Rust Client

Rust client for working with the AG-UI protocol. The client API has been designed to mimic the Typescript client as
close as possible. However, a key difference is that state & messages are not yet an attribute of an implementation of
[`Agent`](src/agent.rs) because it would require `&mut self` for straightforward implementations. This is a work in
progress.

## Example

For each example make sure to read the instructions on starting the associated AG-UI server.

### Basic

```rust,no_run
// no_run: this example connects to a live AG-UI backend (127.0.0.1:3001),
// which is not available during `cargo test`. It is still compiled/type-checked.
use std::error::Error;
use ag_ui_client::{core::types::Message, Agent, HttpAgent, RunAgentParams};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>{
    let agent = HttpAgent::builder()
        .with_url_str("http://127.0.0.1:3001/")?
        .build()?;

    let message = Message::new_user("Can you give me the current temperature in New York?");
    // Create run parameters
    let params = RunAgentParams::new().add_message(message);

    // Run the agent with the subscriber
    let result = agent.run_agent(&params, ()).await?;

    println!("{:#?}", result);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Testing

Tests are organized into categories:

- **Unit tests**: Run with `cargo test` - these test internal logic without external dependencies
- **Integration tests**: Require external services and are marked with `#[ignore]`
  - HTTP agent tests require a running AG-UI server at `localhost:3001`
  - SSE tests require internet access to reach test endpoints

To run integration tests:

```bash
# Start an AG-UI server first, then:
cargo test --test http_agent_test -- --ignored

# For SSE tests (requires internet):
cargo test --test sse_test -- --ignored
```
